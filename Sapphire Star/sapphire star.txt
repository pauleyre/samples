Patch Details for version 1.43
*******************************
16/5/2005

[GENERAL]
- Updated 2da files and compiled both modules for HotU 1.65 support. 
- Updated TLK file and 2da files for CEP 1.51 compatibility. This module DOES NOT require CEP to play. This means that any users who want to add CEP on their own are free to do it. Remember that SS_2da.hak HAS to be on top of the HAK files list when you do this.
- Renamed Interlude to Prelude which is the real purpose of the smaller module :)
- Added missing description for nyths.

[HAK]
- Smaller, 2da HAK has been updated.

The list of fixes from the previous versions is on the bottom of this file.

Installing Sapphire Star
------------------------

Sapphire Star 1.43 requires both SoU and HotU.
Double-click the file "Sapphire Star###mod.exe" and a question will pop-up, asking you would you like to install the module. Click yes, and wait for it to end the installation.
Next; double-click the file "Sapphire Star###HAK.exe" and a question will pop-up, asking you would you like to install the HAK file. Click yes, and wait for it to end the installation.
And last thing to do is to install the HAK file with 2da files. Double-click the file "Sapphire Star###_2da.exe" and a question will pop-up, asking you would you like to install the HAK file. Click yes, and wait for it to end the installation.

Note: ### stands for version number.

Linux users, go here and use this program: http://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-3.2.0.tar.gz

MacOSX users, go here and use this program: http://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarosx-3.2.0.tar.gz

(If the above links don't work, go to http://www.rarlab.com and find the new ones.)

MANUAL INSTALLATION:
Although I highly recommend the automatic installation, who knows what problems may occur. Here's how you'll do it.

Install the WinRar (www.rarlab.com) on your computer. (I use WinRar because of its superiority over the zip format - example: 25 Mb packed in 1.9 Mb) Right click the file "Sapphire Star###mod.exe" (or "Sapphire Star###HAK.exe" or "Sapphire Star###_2da.exe") and select "Open with WinRar". Extract the files within separate folders on your desktop (name them as you wish). Then double-click the file "nwcontinst.exe" and it will automatically install all files to the appropriate NWN folders. After that, you can safely delete the Sapphire Star folder(s) from your desktop.

INSTALLATION WITHOUT "NWCONTINST.EXE"
If you don't want to use "nwcontinst.exe" to install your files, extract each of the following files individually into its target folder as mentioned below.

File				Target Directory in your NWN folder
----				-----------------------------------
Sapphire Star.mod		/modules
Sapphire Star - Prelude.mod	/modules
mus_voiceafar.bmu		/music
SSIntro.bik			/movies
SS_HAK.hak			/hak
SS_2da.hak			/hak
ss_dialog.tlk			/tlk
sapphire star.txt		Wherever you want. It's this very text file.

!!!SPECIAL NOTE!!!
The installation files have a built-in "recovery record". If they become corrupted during the download, open them with WinRar and just hit the Repair button and follow the on-screen instructions. I apologize if this happens.

Uninstalling Sapphire Star
--------------------------

Browse to your NWN directory, and first locate the directory named "hak". Inside it will be files called "SS_HAK.hak" and "SS_2da.hak" or just "SS_HAK" and "SS_2da". Delete them.
Second, locate the directory named "modules". Inside it will be files called "Sapphire Star.mod", "Sapphire Star - Prelude.mod" and "Sapphire Star.txt" or just "Sapphire Star". Delete them.
Locate the folder named "music". Inside it will be a file named "mus_voiceafar.bmu" or just "mus_voiceafar". Delete it. Find a file named "ss_dialog.tlk" or just "ss_dialog" inside your "tlk" folder and delete it.

Optimizing Sapphire Star
------------------------

The Sapphire Star was created on a high-end computer when compared to the default "Recommended System" for NWN OC. Because of this, and my inability to test the module on a weaker configuration, I cannot guarantee the full stability. However, don't fear. The NWN already has a built-in *optimizer* to prevent such things from happening as much as possible. So, if you find that your game's slowing down, try adjusting your video or audio settings within NWN.
Also, be sure you have enough space on your hard drive. Save game files are of notable sizes.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
"Sapphire Star - Interlude" (in the game) *may* crush your computer because of the processor usage. *Only* if it crashes your game, try lowering down the graphic or sound performance options for just that part of the game. You can safely return to the old settings later.

ISSUES:

One user had problems with Autosaving. If you find that your game's crashing when attempting to Autosave, disable it. You can disable it in the game via custom options dialog (see below) or you can disable it outside of the game. Find the file "nwnplayer.ini" inside your NWN directory and open it. Find the following line "Disable AutoSave=0", under the "[Server Options]". Change its numeric value to 1.

The Sapphire Star
-----------------

The Sapphire star is the first part of the Forgotten Realms PnP campaign we are still playing, the Guardian. We finished that part, the second one, Shadows of the Past, and are currently making our way through the third one. The work on the sequel has started and I'll be joining forces with Arntuuri, the storywriter.

The Sapphire Star is designed as a single-player experience. Unfortunately, I don't have any possibilities to develop and test it as a multi-player module. However, I believe it could be run with multiple players, but the balance would be surely toppled.

It is *highly* recommend to start the game with a 1st-level character. By the end, you should rise to levels 9 or 10 (or 10 - 11 if you're playing a rogue).

NOTES ON THE IN-GAME CONTENT:

* Intro text with punctuation signs.

A journey
takes me to
the Spine of the World.

A shroud of darkness
falls over it.

Children of evil, unite!
Mortals, stand against them
or become dust!
Freedom is bleeding...
I have been called.

* Problems with Sapphire Star - Interlude (Battle of Elveldar).

Follow this link and everything should be fine: http://www.terransystem.com/SSMap.JPG

* Custom Options Dialog.

I added the custom options dialog to the game that currently supports two options AutoSave and Extraordinary Battles. To bring it up later in the game stand near Xarsus and type in OPT or opt into your Talk window.

- AutoSave: You can enable or disable autosaving at important locations. I added this because there was some earlier bad experience with fault save games. Default: Enabled.

- Extraordinary Battles: Some fights are modified to be harder on Hardcore or Difficult game modes. You can enable them this way on lower difficulties. Default: Disabled.

* Problems with alignment shifts.

Some players with alignment-dependent characters (druids, paladins, etc.) experienced problems with alignment shifts within the game.
I was thinking about creating an alignment system through scripting that would be more generous on those characters. But, instead of lowering game's performance with new scripts, I decided to suggest something already in the game.
You may have noticed this already, but the dialog with one beggar (the one outside the Silver Dragon inn) has numerous alignment shifts in it.
Although he wasn't created for this purpose, you can easily use him to tweak your alignment.

* Curing lycanthropy.

There are three ways to deal with this disease. In all three ways you will acquire belladonna, a powerful cure and a poison also.
1 - During nighttime, go to Hluthvar Pass near the entrance to Hluthvar. Speak with Selune's priest and finish his quests.
2 - Find a pile of stones near the entrance to Cave of Shadows and crush them. You will find belladonna beneath them.
3 - Donate 1000 gold to Helm's donation pool in Hluthvar's Temple of Helm.

Note that in order to properly use belladonna you must succeed at a Heal check or a Fortitude save vs. DC 20.

* Garrote.

This weapon deals 1d6 points of blunt damage + 1 1/2 of your Strength bonus, plus it stuns the victim for 4 seconds. It won't have any effect on creatures without any flesh or extremely huge creatures. Also, you have to be near the victim to use it.
It uses the rules for its use as they were presented in "Song and Silence": a successful melee touch attack and a grapple check against the target will strangle the target for one round. Since I wasn't able to add a real grapple, the one that lasts round after round, I added the stun effect. Using it while engaged in active combat is hard since you and your target are constantly moving: there is only 33% chance that you'll succeed in wrapping it around target's neck.

* Sacrifices for Tempus' altar.

Note that in order to have access to the altar you have to join the Temple of Tempus or solve Kandar's quest.
Also; if the combination doesn't seem to work, try not to stack items, but put them on altar separately (or the other way around).
Items marked with a "-" before them work only once, and those with a "+" before them work as much as you want.

- Knuckle: Skeleton's knuckle + quartz crystal + 2500 GP
- Fire Dagger: Dagger + fire beetle belly + 1000 GP
- Crimson Harp: Red torch + Sapphire gem + 1000 GP
- Scales of the Battlebringer Armor: Scale mail + 4500 GP
- Shield of Sacrifice: Large shield + 2000 GP
- Sprayed with Holy Blood Cloak: Cloak of Protection +1 + 3000 GP
+ Potion of Barkskin: Ironwood
+ Potion of Cure Moderate Wounds: 2 potions of cure light wounds
+ Potion of Cure Serious Wounds: 2 potions of cure moderate wounds
+ Potion of Cure Light Wounds: Goodberry + 2 GP

* Brewing potions.

You can learn how to brew potions from Ander, Silbran's herbalist.
Note that a small amount of XP is deducted from you as per PHB rules. 
Here are the combinations of various plants. Sometimes, mixing wrong components together results in unexpected things happening to you :)

- Herbal potion of Cure Light Wounds: Goodberry + empty flask + 10 GP
- Herbal potion of Cure Moderate Wounds: Witch flower + empty flask + 16 GP
- Herbal potion of Cure Serious Wounds: Green ear + empty flask + 33 GP
- Potion of Greater Barkskin: Ancient Ironwood + empty flask + 60 GP
- Elixir of Owlbear: Blue Varschav + empty flask + 60 GP
- Elixir of Magic Wall: Red Varschav + empty flask + 450 GP
- Elixir of Red Wyrm: Fire Root + empty flask + 300 GP

* The Respawn button doesn't work.

Solution: None. The Respawn button was disabled by me. I think that it will harm the game's balance and it will certainly break the plot. (Some hostile persons will become friendly because of it.) I never had any intentions of enabling it in the first place. Sorry.

* Resting in some areas unavailable.

Solution: Rent a room in inn or rest in the wilderness. Don't rest on public places or in other people's homes.

* You can't equip an item because your level is too low.

Solution: Find the file "nwnplayer.ini" inside your NWN directory and open it. Find the following line "Single Player ItemLevelRestrictions=1", under the "[Game Options]". Change its numeric value to "0" (zero).

* Person X doesn't want to talk to you anymore.

Solution: There may be a solution and there may not be one. It all depends on the character that doesn't want to talk with you anymore. The cause of this is your action, which caused the person to ignore you. It was probably angered by something you did.

* The battle X is too hard.

Solution: Combat in this module is challenging. Try different tactics and approach, perhaps some henchman could be of help. If all else fails, you rushed into an area that confronted you with a conflict intended for higher levels of your party. This could easily happen since the module is non-linear. Or, you could be in combat that was never intended to happen or be won by player. Also remember that you can always lower the game's difficulty level.

* The game won't play with my custom (or hacked) character.

Solution: I never supported hacked characters, but it may happen that a non-hacked character is rejected by the game. To fix this, find the file "nwnplayer.ini" inside your NWN directory and open it. Find the following line "Single Player Enforce Legal Characters=1", under the "[Game Options]". Change its numeric value to "0" (zero).

* Some elves in the game have strange skin color.

Answer: They are Fearun's elves: Sun (bronze), Moon (light blue), Wild (dark brown), and Wood (copper).

* I'm not satisfied with the quality of this module.

Answer: This whole module was developed by a single person (me). I'm sorry if I didn't succeed in meeting your expectations, but at least try to understand that it takes a lot of work and time to create something like this. If you would like to see something new added to the module, such as a new response in conversation or else, just send me an e-mail or post it at the website.

* Spoilers and Tips

Solution: Send me an e-mail with the question or post it on Sapphire Star's page.

* I have found an error. Should I fix it or should I inform you?

Solution: First, I apologize if this happens. I tried very hard to avoid any errors. You could fix the error if you knew how, but that choice isn't supported by me. The best thing to do is to send me an e-mail with the description of the error or to post it on Sapphire Star's site. Any suggestions on fixing it are also welcome. I'll fix the error and inform you about the update.

************************SAPPHIRE STAR HINTBOOK************************
			**********************

This hintbook isn't a walkthrough but a collection of useful hints and secrets (mostly) for common problems players are having in this module -- combat and exploration. I'm not going to write to whom you should talk or how to solve a particular quest here... that part of the job is left to you. Sapphire Star's site on NWVault contains lots of useful info for solving any quest. Also, in version 1.31, I updated the info you gain for quests so you should be able to finish any of them without my help here.
Reading the part named "THINGS TO FIND & DO" will ruin the element of surprise for you. It's a full list (I hope) of things to find or do in Sapphire Star. I warned you... :)

*********************************
INDEX
I. Henchman
II. Combat & Enemies
III. Quest & things to find & do
*********************************

************
I. HENCHMEN
************

They are:

- Brakk Ma Tok: Male drow barbarian (raised by orcs). Found in the Silver Dragon inn in Silbran.
If you drop him from your group, he won't follow you again unless your Charisma is 15 or higher.
There's also a special encounter related to Brakk's story in good/neutral plot course. To access this encounter, talk to Brakk about his story and then talk to the drow woman in Hluthvar's Hall of Order. Let me just add, good luck!

- Niclai: Male human Red Wizard transmuter specialist. Found in Red Wizard enclave. He'll attack you if you say that you'll never return for him once you drop him out of your group.

- Slasher: Male half-winter wolf. Found in Orc Village. He won't join you if you merged with Toth-Draconis. You have to give him some meat if you want him as a henchman.

- Taba: Female dwarf rogue, ex-noble. Found outside the ruined castle.

- Sidoc: Male quasit bard. He's actually an Easter egg and you can find him in one tower-like building in northern Hluthvar. A minimum level of 4 is required to make him travel with you.

*********************
II. COMBAT & ENEMIES
*********************

Abishai
-------
Location: Nine Hells.
Best Tactic: Hurt them with electricity attacks. Also, they have a very high regeneration rate. Don't enter Nine Hells until you're at least level 6.

Ankhegs
-------
Location: Swamps, around the center.
Best Tactic: Use ranged weapons. Surviving their tremendous bite attack is hard. Avoid these buggers until you reach at least level 3. Also, there's a tikky mother (a more powerful ankheg) there.

Ayrestat
--------
Location: Can't reveal that, sorry.
Best Tactic: These are Monty Wall's tactics, which he generously allowed me to use here.

a) drink every additive potion in sight in the right order (invisibility, strength, aid, bless, speed).
b) use the +2 greatsword (or dual wield something appropriate).
c) bring the dwarf thief (Taba -- Ed.) loaded with bolt's of lightning
...
d) just charge. Most Wizards can't take 30+ points a round and get many spells off.
e) also bring a scroll of breach, just in case :)

I will also add a tip to stay away from his area spells. Also, arcane spellcasters should save any flying eyeballs or spellsword bracers for him.

Bonebats
--------
Location: Cave of Shadows.
Best Tactic: Hurt them with blunt weapons. They have a pretty high AC and they're fast. Also, they're undead beings.

Frigid Beasts
-------------
Location: Outside and inside the ruined castle.
Best Tactic: Use ranged weapons. They have a powerful melee cold attack, but they're slow. Upon their death, they also release a cold blast attack to all in close range, which will deal cold damage and slow you for a few seconds on a failed Reflex save. Of course, they don't love fire.
Frigid monster is a more powerful frigid beast.

Goblins
-------
Location: Reaching Woods and beyond.
Best Tactic: Calis on NWVault suggested using animal empathy to turn their pets against them. I know that turning a dire wolf against them is very useful. Area spells, such as confusion, fireball, or call lightning are VERY useful. Hit and run tactic should also be considered. Lastly, don't go against them until you're at least level 4 or 5.

King Zumunay
------------
Location: Goblin Stronghold.
Best Tactic: Many times players said to me that he's one of the toughest fights for melee players. Spellcaster will easily turn him to dust with strong offensive spells. Melee players on the other hand have to face the king in close combat... Which has proven to be deadly on many occasions. Potion of speed and a high AC are your ticket to defeating him. Also, a few well-placed powderkegs can hurt him badly. There are two powderkegs inside the goblin stronghold.

Kyeresa
-------
Location: Hmm... I would ruin some surprises if I reveal her location.
Best Tactic: People find her aura of cold to be deadly. kenfragger on NwVault suggested the spell gust of wind which removes her deadly aura. I myself never used that spell. My best tactic was to protect myself and my henchman against her fear and cold damage and try to hurt her with fire while someone keeps her busy in melee.

Malar Panther
-------------
Location: Just behind the entrance to Cave of Shadows.
Best Tactic: Stratovarius suggested using phantasmal killer on it. Henchman Brakk can easily kill it. Also, potion of speed or spell haste is recommended.

Nyth
------
Location: Firewisp Bridge, Dryad Tree Roots
Best Tactic: Attack them with anything but fire or electricity else they will multiply. Also they can turn magic missile against the caster.

Trolls
------
Location: Swamps, eastern part.
Best Tactic: Bring acid- or fire-based weapons or spells with you. Troll berserker will be harder to bring down. I recommend avoiding them until level 7.

Vampiric Wolf
-------------
Location: Dryad Tree Roots
Best Tactic: Holy spells and +1 arrows. A slow spell is also useful.

Wererats
--------
Location: Unexplored caverns of the silver mine.
Best Tactic: They're low on HP but have a very good damage reduction. A +1 weapon or a silver weapon (or ammunition) is needed to defeat them without any problems. Also, be careful when fighting them since they can inflict you with lycanthropy.

Xilla
-----
Location: Surprise :P
Best Tactic: Buff yourself and Brakk, bring lots of healing potions and try to be fast, very fast. Summoning any creatures or dispel magic are also very useful.

************
VERSION 1.35
************

[GENERAL]
- Added an optional intro movie for the game. The game will start fine with or without it. Take note that the intro text doesn't have any punctuation characters because it's song-like, so some lines might look like my bad English.

[RULES]

************
VERSION 1.30
************

[Please note that the following list isn't complete. I will only mention mayor changes in this version. I am sure old players will recognize new additions without me mentioning them here.]


[GENERAL]
- Optimized all scripts and reduced the size of the module to 25 Mb. This should prevent any crashing while saving/loading a game.
- Enhanced in-game performance.

- You will now receive larger amounts of XP.

[DIALOG]
- Fixed grammatical errors in all dialogs (please, inform me if I and Arntuuri missed something).

************

- Fixed a journal entry not being marked as the last one in Kizzaf's quest.

[HAK]
- Fixed graphical glitches in katar's and fang's inventory icons. Take note that the fix is in smaller, Sapphire Star124_2da.exe file, not in the bigger one. You just need to download the smaller HAK to fix this.

**************
VERSION 1.23b
**************

[GENERAL]
- Changed the module back to NWN 1.30 from SoU. It wasn't fair for those who didn't have SoU. This won't stop the SoU players from playing the module, that is, this version is for NWN 1.30 players only.

**************
VERSION 1.23a
**************

[DIALOG]
- Fixed a bug in Kizzaf's quest, which was preventing the player from finishing it.

*************
VERSION 1.23

- Updated spell scroll creation system. Thanks Brandon!
- Players (those of 1st level only) will be adequately equipped in the start.

[HAK]

*************

*************

- Rogues will now have the opportunity to *visit* two noble houses in Hluthvar.
- Added a quest for clerics and paladins in Hluthvar.

**************

- Fixed a diminutive bug from version 1.07 that caused the game's hardest fight to be impossible.

*************
