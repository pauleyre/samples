			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Orbicon, system for publishing and managment of content on the internet pages. In the following few moments we will describe the basic elements and capabilites of Orbicon system, followed by basic usage examples.</p>
			<p>In order to follow this Tutorial and use the system at the same time, <a href="?en=orbicon" target="_blank">click here</a> to open your Desktop.</p>

			<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut01.png" alt="#" title="#" /></p>
			<p>Desktop is system's front page. The main menu is positioned on the top of the screen. Most menu buttons have their own submenus which are displayed when mouse cursor is hovered over them. Submenus can be closed by clicking anywhere.</p>
			<p>Buttons &quot;Desktop&quot;, &quot;Languages&quot;, &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; are always available while access to other sections depends on your privileges. Accessing any option from the submenu will display option's window from where we can control its functionalities. (Each window has two panels, workspace on the left, settings and tools sidebar on the right)</p>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut02.png" alt="#" title="#" /></p>
			<p>System's front page is also a desktop.</p>
			<p>This desktop is unique to each user and can be modified by its owner. Every system window has its own icon on the left which can be added or removed from desktop by clicking the icon</p>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut03.png" alt="#" title="#" /><br />The icon is on the desktop and can be removed by clicking green checkmark.</p>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut04.png" alt="#" title="#" /><br />The icon is not on the desktop and can be added by clicking the the red X.</p>
			<p>Besides icons, your desktop can read and display RSS feeds and show current time.</p>

			<h2>Managing content</h2>
			<p>Orbicon framework's main and most important function is publishing of all sort of data formats such as texts, images, video, music, banners, etc. However, before publishing we have to properly add our files to the system. How, we'll find out in the next chapter.</p>

			<h2>Managing text content</h2>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut05.png" alt="#" title="#" /></p>
			<p>Open menu &quot;Databases&quot;, and select &quot;Texts&quot; from submenu. The window &quot;Texts&quot; opens. On the right sidebar we can see that the card entitled &quot;Database browser&quot; is opened. This is the database for all text documents. Since this is our first usage of the system we will be prompted to create our first text category. We create our first category by typing the name and submitting it. (We can see our newly created category on the right.) Now we can create a text article. We enter text's title, for example &quot;my article&quot; and submit it. The system saves text and brings up the advanced text editor. Inside text editor we can write our article's content, save it or modify it.</p>
			<p>What have we accomplished so far? We created text database category and inside of it we have created text &quot;my article&quot;. If we wish to add additional text to our category, we simply type in another article title and submit it.</p>

			<h2>Managing graphical documents</h2>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut06.png" alt="#" title="#" /></p>
			<p>Open submenu &quot;Images&quot; inside menu &quot;Databases&quot;. Open card &quot;Add new&quot; on the sidebar if it's closed. Drag and drop selected image(s) from your computer and release them over the area to upload them to the server. After successful upload you can confirm the action by refreshing your browser with F5 or reloading the page. Your images will be shown below.</p>

			<h2>Managing miscellaneous documents</h2>
			<p><img src="orbicon/controler/intro/images/tut07.png" alt="#" title="#" /></p>
			<p>Open submenu &quot;Documents&quot; inside menu &quot;Database&quot;. On the right sidebar are your document categories and on the left side is the list of those currently in the system. Adding documents follows the same pattern as uploading the images. Select the document and drag and drop it over the upload area in the right sidebar. After successful upload you can manually reload the page to view newly added documents.</p>
			<p>Besided &quot;drag and drop&quot; method, images and documents can be added by using the &quot;Browse&quot; button.</p>
		</page>

			<h2>Columns</h2>
			<p>&quot;Columns&quot; (which are available under menu &quot;Content&quot;) enables us to create and organize horizontal and vertical menus, boxes and internal pages. If we open &quot;Columns&quot; we can see that the system allows us to select which menu we wish to edit. We could try to add 5 pagest to horizontal menu. We select the horizontal menu graphic, type in the page's title on the right sidebar and submit it. Once we are finished with all 5 pages, we can rearrange their order with &quot; drag and drop&quot;.</p>

			<h2>Using news dashboard</h2>
			<p>After adding documents to the system, we can use them in our news entries. Under menu &quot;Content&quot; we select submenu &quot;News dashboard&quot;. On the left panel, we can see the list of news from all categories. To add a new entry we must click &quot;Add new&quot; (located on the bottom).</p>
			<p>The newly opened window, entitled &quot;News&quot;, is ready to create new news entry. A news entry is composed of various properties but the most important ones are title, lead text, full text entry, publish date, and published status. To use an article previously created in Texts database, we must navigate to that text using &quot;Database browser&quot; on the right sidebar.</p>
			<p>We can also select our lead text image this way.</p>
			<p>After selecting texts and optionally, an image for news, we must select publish date and set published status to &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> News can be published with dates set in future.</p>

			<h2>Template editing</h2>
			<p>
				Managing your web site's template can be done using &quot;Layout editor&quot; (accessible under menu &quot;Tools&quot;).
				On the left panel we can see all files used in site's template (these are located under <strong>site &gt; gfx</strong> directory)
